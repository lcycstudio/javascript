### Module Introduction

### What Are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?

#### Component-Driven User Interfaces

- Building interactive & scalable UIs
- React Core Syntax & JSX
- Working with Components
- Working with Data

HTML, CSS & JavaScript are about building user interfaces as well

React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler.

#### React is all about Components

All user interfaces in the end are made up of components

#### Why Components?

- Reusability
  - Don't repeat yourself
- Separation of Concerns
  - Don't do too many things in one and the same place

### React Code Is Written In A "Declarative Way"!

![React Component](<https://github.com/lcycstudio/javascript/blob/master/React%20-%20The%20Complete%20Guide%202023%20(incl.%20React%20Router%20%26%20Redux)/03_react_basics_&_working_with_components/course.png>)

#### React & Components

- React allows you to create **re-usable** and **reactive** components consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- React uses the **declarative approach** where we define the desired target state(s) and let React figure
  out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions
