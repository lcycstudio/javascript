### Welcome To The Course!

### What is React.js?

#### React

React is a **JavaScript** library for building **user interfaces**

[Vanilla JavaScript Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-js-demo-6049kj?file=/index.js)

[React Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/first-react-app-start-7ec9fd)

![JavaScript to React](<https://github.com/lcycstudio/javascript/blob/master/React%20-%20The%20Complete%20Guide%202023%20(incl.%20React%20Router%20%26%20Redux)/01_getting_started/react-js.png>)

#### Why not JavaScript?

- It quickly becomes **cumbersome**
- It quickly becomes **error-prone**
- It quickly becomes **hard to maintain** or edit
- **React** offers a way **simpler "mental model"**

### ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript": Why Use React?

React = Declarative UI Programming

With React, you **define the target UI state(s)** -- not the steps to get there

Instead, React will figure out & perform the necessary steps

### Creating React Projects: Browser-based vs Local Development

#### Local Setup

- Create React projects locally on your system
- Requires installation of tools & creation of files on your system
- Use a locally installed code editor (e.g., VS Code) with any settings
  and extensions of your choice

#### Browser-based Setup

- Create remote React projects via CodeSandbox (or similar)
- No software installed, no files created on your local system
- Use a (mostly) pre-configured code editor inside of your browser

### Creating React Projects Locally

#### Installation

- Node.js
- VS Code
- Extensions "prettier"
- Create React App
  - npx: `npx create-react-app my-app`
  - npm: `npm create-react-app my-app`

### Using CodeSandbox For React Development (No Local Setup Required!)

Navigate to the browser and enter `react.new` and select "React - CodeSandbox - react.new"
