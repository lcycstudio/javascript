| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lokka         | As simple as possible. Basic queries, mutations. Some simple caching.                 |
| Apollo Client | Produced by the same guys as Meteor JS. Good balance between features and complexity. |
| Relay         | Amazing performance for mobile. By far the most insanely complex.                     |
